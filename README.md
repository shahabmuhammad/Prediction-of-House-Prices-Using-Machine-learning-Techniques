# Prediction-of-House-Prices-Using-Machine-learning-Techniques

## introduction:
Predictions of house sales prices is a challenging machine learning problems, because house sales prices
not only depend on the height, width and number of rooms of the house but lots of other aspect are also
involved in influence of sales prices of houses. And this project we apply three machine learning
algorithm and find which one is best suit for this problem.

## About Dataset:
The dataset contain 79 variables and describing almost every aspect of residential homes in this project
we design a machine learning model to predict the final price of each home using these 79 variables.
